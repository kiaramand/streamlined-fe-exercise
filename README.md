# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### notes

thought about using react-hook-form (would have been more performant so would prefer this in reality)
have feedback on design

would likely want to be persisting state


### assumptions

negative totals are okay as it's possible a refund is being issued
